The bresenham module
====================

A simple implementation of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm.

See `the Wikipedia entry`_ for details on what that is.

.. _the Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm

Note that this is a simple implementation.
It is written in Pure Python (without e.g. `numpy`), so it is relatively slow.

I found some beauty in combining the classic algorithm (whose ingenuity lies in
using only integers – a constraint that isn't really as relevant now)
with a Python generator (a modern device that follows the spirit of
“executable pseudocode”, abstracting away the output subroutine).
I hope others can appreciate the code as well.

For serious use, look at these:

* `skimage.draw.line`_, which solves the same problem *fast*.
* A `Numpy-based recipe`_ that generalizes the solution to <var>N</var>
  dimensions.

Installation
============

In a Python virtual environment, do::

    python -m pip install bresenham

To install from a Git checkout (in editable mode)::

    python -m pip install -e.

To install without a virtual envitonment, add the ``--user`` option.


Usage
=====

The ``bresenham(x0, y0, x1, y1)`` function returns a generator of
the coordinates of the line from ``(x0, y0)`` to ``(x1, y1)``.

For example, the coordinates of a line from (-1, -4) to (3, 2), are::

    >>> from bresenham import bresenham

    >>> list(bresenham(-1, -4, 3, 2))
    [(-1, -4), (0, -3), (0, -2), (1, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2)]
